Aaradhana was founded in 2002 by renowned hindi poet and satirist from agra shri pawan aagri with the aim to organize events and campaigns on social issues. Dr (mrs) hirdesh chaudhary an educationist, social activist and writer joined Aaradhana after resigning from her government job to work for upliftment of nomadic children in 2010. Subsequently, Aaradhana was registered on 26.11.2010 under rule 21 of society?s act 1860 in agra with the aim to work for educational upliftment of underprivileged and disadvantageous sections of the society. Initially, Aaradhana started with awareness campaigns and events in the form of kavi sammelans touching most critical social issues such as female feticide, communal tensions, illiteracy, etc. Aaradhana has been organizing all indiakavi sammelans and mushairas to maintain peace and harmony in the city of taj. Aaradhana has been organizing female literacy meets through Aaradhana lekhika manch to provide a platform for budding female writers and housewives to express their views on various issues concerning society and the nation. Aaradhana has adopted 15 primary government schools in akola block where it has focused its attention to provide clean drinking water and toilet facilities for boys and girls. Aaradhana has got 4 schools equipped with drinking water and toilet facilities through indian oil corporation limited. Such facilities will soon be provided in other schools as indian oil has already approved these projects. Aaradhana started spreading its wings to educate the most neglected sections of the society through its prestigious mission shiksha bane jeevan jyoti. It focused its attention to educate gadhiya luhar community whose literacy rate is a big zero and where none of ngos work.
